## Overview

### The Challenge/User Stories

Create a website quickly and launch it using GitHub. The website should have a navbar that holds the logo and a search engine. The body of the website should contain 3 cards named "meat," "rice," and "drink." Make the search engine responsive so that when a visitor searches for any of the cards, the relevant one pops up.
